# Using CSV Files as a Database

Agent AI can generate or use CSV files as a lightweight database solution. To do this:

1. **Generate a CSV File**:  
	Agent AI can create a CSV file with headers and initial data.

2. **Read/Write Operations**:  
	Use standard file I/O operations to read from and write to the CSV file.

3. **Example CSV Structure**:
	```csv
	username,password
	admin,admin
	root,root
	```

4. **Best Practices**:  
	- Ensure proper handling of file locks and concurrency.
	- Validate data before writing to the CSV.

This approach is suitable for small-scale or prototyping needs.
