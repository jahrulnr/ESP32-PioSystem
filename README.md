# MVC Framework Implementation for OSSystem Hotspot

## Overview of Changes

We've implemented an MVC-based architecture for the OSSystem ESP32 project with a focus on WiFi hotspot functionality. Here's what has been added:

### 1. Controllers
- Created `WifiController` to handle WiFi hotspot management:
  - Status endpoint for current WiFi information
  - AP start/stop/update functionality
  - Network scanning
  - Client management

### 2. Models
- `WifiClient` model for representing connected clients
- `WifiConfig` model for AP configuration management

### 3. Views
- `dashboard.html` - Main interface for managing the WiFi hotspot
- `login.html` - Authentication page

### 4. Routes
- Added HTTP routes for WiFi management API endpoints
- Added WebSocket route for real-time WiFi status updates
- Updated web routes to serve HTML files from SPIFFS

### 5. Application Setup
- Modified `main.cpp` to initialize the MVC framework
- Configured WiFi manager to start in AP mode

## Usage Instructions

1. Flash the application to your ESP32 device
2. The device will create a WiFi hotspot with SSID "OSSystem-AP" and password "password123"
3. Connect to this hotspot from your phone or computer
4. Open your web browser and navigate to http://192.168.4.1
5. You'll see the dashboard interface where you can:
   - View hotspot status
   - See connected clients
   - Manage hotspot settings

## Next Steps

To fully complete the implementation, consider the following enhancements:

1. Implement proper authentication for the API endpoints
2. Add data persistence for AP configuration
3. Enhance client tracking with more detailed statistics
4. Implement a captive portal for automatic redirect to the dashboard
5. Add functionality to save and load multiple hotspot configurations
6. Implement local DNS for better user experience
7. Add traffic monitoring capabilities
